## Setting up

1. Fork this repository and clone the fork.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Edit the `DATABASE_URL` variable in `.env`, swapping `YOUR_DATABASE_URL` for the URL of the database you just created. Leave `?schema=prisma` at the end.
4. Edit the `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` variable in `.env`, swapping `YOUR_SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` for the URL of a shadow database you created in an earlier exercise. Leave `?schema=shadow` at the end.
5. Run `npm ci` to install the project dependencies.
6. Run `npx prisma migrate reset` to execute the database migrations. Press `y` when it asks if you're sure.

## Instructions

- Run the app with `npm start` - this will open a React app in your browser *and* run the express server. The server will default to port `4000`, you can change this by adding an `API_PORT` variable to your `.env` if you want.
